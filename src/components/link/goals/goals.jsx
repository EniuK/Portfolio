        <p>
          I know from experience that working hard and smart will give you good
          results but you cant stop doing what you think is right. How i know
          that? One of many examples is that I simply lost 40kg weight in a bit
          more than a year. I was also training one of the hardest sports
          existing - calisthenics. Its a training based on your body weight so
          it was pretty hard quest to do while you are overweight.
